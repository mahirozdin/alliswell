## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Auth — registration (OPH-020): `POST /api/v1/auth/register` creates the user, their personal
  workspace and owner membership in one transaction; passwords hashed with argon2id; returns a
  15-minute JWT access token and a 30-day opaque refresh token (stored only as a keyed hash).
  Duplicate emails answer `409 AUTH_EMAIL_TAKEN`. Production now refuses to boot with missing,
  placeholder, short or identical JWT secrets.
- Monorepo skeleton: npm workspaces, `apps/api` (Node.js/Fastify) and `apps/app` (Flutter).
- Project documentation set: `README.md`, `docs/BLUEPRINT.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/STATE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, ADRs 0001–0004.
- Docker Compose stack: MySQL 8.4 + Redis 8 (+ optional `api` and `adminer` profiles).
- API skeleton (`@alliswell/api`): Fastify 5 (ESM JavaScript), env config loader, request-id logging,
  security plugins (helmet/cors/rate-limit), MySQL (knex) and Redis (ioredis) plugins,
  `/health/live` and `/health/ready` endpoints with JSON-schema responses.
- Knex migration baseline for the full core schema: users, workspaces, workspace_members,
  refresh_tokens, projects, tags, tasks, task_tags, checklist_items, notes, note_tags, note_links,
  sync_revisions, client_mutations, calendar_accounts, calendar_event_links, reminders.
- Flutter multi-platform shell (iOS/Android/Web/macOS/Windows/Linux) with Riverpod + go_router and
  adaptive navigation (rail on desktop, bottom bar on mobile).
- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions): API lint + unit tests + migrations + integration tests against real
  MySQL/Redis services, Flutter analyze + test, TypeScript-ban guard.
