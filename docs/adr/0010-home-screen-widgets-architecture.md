# ADR-0010 — Home-screen / desktop widgets: native views over an App-Group snapshot

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-17
- **Related task:** Epic 12 (OPH-130…136)
- **Related:** feedback round 5 (user request: iOS/Android/macOS home-screen
  widgets in three sizes that stay in sync with tasks, summarize the Home buckets
  in a scroll, carry an Apple-Calendar-style date header at the largest size, and
  offer quick-add + quick-complete like Apple Reminders); docs/WIDGETS.md (the
  binding research/design plan); BLUEPRINT §12.8, §15.6; docs/DESIGN.md §8;
  ADR-0003 (`alliswell://task/{id}` scheme reused for widget deep links)

## Context

The app must gain **home-screen / desktop widgets** on the platforms that have
that surface (iOS, iPadOS, Android, macOS). Requirements: three sizes; the widget
mirrors Home's chronological buckets (Overdue → No date → Today → This week → This
month) in a scroll; the largest size shows an Apple-Calendar-style date header
(day-of-week name + day number, optional month/week strip); and quick-add +
tap-to-complete work **from the widget without opening the app** (Apple Reminders
behavior). The widget must **stay in sync** with task data.

Three hard platform facts shape everything (full citations in docs/WIDGETS.md):

1. **A widget runs in a separate process/sandbox and cannot read the app's drift/
   SQLite replica.** Data must cross a shared container.
2. **A widget is an OS App-Extension target**, not something a Flutter plugin
   package can vend. Unlike the EventKit bridge (a federated SwiftPM plugin,
   pbxproj untouched), widgets **require committed Xcode targets + `project.pbxproj`
   edits + entitlements** in `ios/` and `macos/`, and a native receiver in
   `android/`.
3. **iPhone's largest home-screen widget is `systemLarge` (4×4, ~2/3 screen).**
   There is **no 4×6 / full-screen home-screen widget on iPhone** in WidgetKit —
   the only size above 4×4 is `systemExtraLarge` (~8×4 landscape), **iPad + macOS
   only**. The user's "4×6 / full screen" tier therefore cannot exist on iPhone.

## Decision

1. **Bridge with the `home_widget` package** (Dart ↔ native). It wraps App Groups
   (iOS/macOS) and SharedPreferences (Android) behind one API — `setAppGroupId`,
   `saveWidgetData`, `getWidgetData`, `updateWidget`, `registerInteractivityCallback` —
   and provides the background-intent plumbing (`HomeWidgetBackgroundWorker.run`
   on iOS, `HomeWidgetBackgroundIntent.getBroadcast` on Android). New dependency.
2. **The widget renders a minimal, app-produced JSON snapshot — not the DB, not a
   Flutter render.** A pure `groupTasksForWidget` (sibling of `groupTasksForHome`,
   fully unit-tested) projects the open-task + event streams into buckets; a
   serializer writes a **small** JSON snapshot of exactly what the widget shows
   (date-header fields, each bucket's top *N* rows with `{id, title, done,
   projectColorHex, timeLabel}`, and per-bucket counts). Labels are **already
   localized by the app** (Epic 11 / ADR-0009) so the native widget carries no
   translation bundle. Keep the snapshot in single-digit KB (App-Group
   `UserDefaults` is memory-mapped and the widget extension has a ~30 MB budget).
3. **Native views for the interactive tiers (SwiftUI on Apple, Jetpack Glance on
   Android), NOT `renderFlutterWidget`.** Interactivity (`Button/Toggle(intent:)`,
   Glance `actionRunCallback`) requires real native controls; a rasterized Flutter
   image cannot host per-row buttons. `renderFlutterWidget` is reserved, if ever,
   for a non-interactive rich tier.
4. **Quick-complete / quick-add run through the local-first store.** Widget taps
   fire an `AppIntent` (iOS 17+/macOS 14+) or a Glance action (Android) →
   `home_widget` background isolate → a `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` Dart callback →
   `TaskStore.complete()` / `TaskStore.create()` (the SAME optimistic-write +
   outbox path the UI uses, so widget edits sync to the server) → `updateWidget`.
   **Pre-iOS-17 floor: deep link only** — the tap opens the app at
   `alliswell://task/{id}` (ADR-0003) / `alliswell://add`, gated `@available(iOS
   17, *)`.
5. **Freshness = foreground push + a light self-refresh timeline.** After every
   relevant drift write, while the app is foreground, call `updateWidget` — these
   reloads are **budget-exempt** (Apple), so the widget stays in lock-step for
   free; app-intent taps on the widget are exempt too. A sparse WidgetKit timeline
   (`.after`/midnight rollover) and an Android WorkManager midnight job re-bucket
   Today/Overdue when the app never opens, staying inside Apple's 40–70 reloads/day.
6. **Size mapping, with the iPhone ceiling documented as a constraint:**
   | User tier | Apple family | Android | iPhone reality |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | 4×2 (~⅓) | `systemMedium` | 4×2 cells | ✅ |
   | 4×4 (~⅔) | `systemLarge` | 4×4 cells | ✅ (iPhone max) |
   | 4×6 / full | `systemExtraLarge` (iPad/macOS only) | true 4×6 (resizable) | ❌ → degrades to `systemLarge` |
   `supportedFamilies: [.systemMedium, .systemLarge, .systemExtraLarge]` (iPhone
   filters out extraLarge automatically). Android widgets are user-resizable, so
   the three are *defaults*, built as responsive `SizeF` layouts.
7. **App Group id `group.com.alliswell.alliswell`**, byte-identical across the
   Dart `setAppGroupId`, both iOS entitlements (Runner + extension), and both
   macOS entitlements (DebugProfile + Release). macOS needs App-Sandbox +
   `com.apple.security.application-groups`; entitlements are edited **directly in
   the plist files** (Flutter guidance), and the `<TeamID>.group.…` vs `group.…`
   form is decided once and used consistently (macOS `home_widget` does not add
   the team prefix for you).
8. **Platform scope:** iOS, iPadOS, Android, macOS get widgets. **Web, Windows,
   Linux have no home-screen-widget surface in scope** (Windows Widgets Board is a
   separate niche API, deferred) — the feature hides itself there, like the Apple
   calendar card does off-Apple platforms.
9. **Privacy:** the snapshot carries task titles and lives in the sandbox-
   protected App-Group container. A **"Private widget"** option (reusing the
   Epic-07 privacy ethos) renders counts/placeholders instead of titles for users
   who don't want content on a glanceable surface. Documented in §15.6.

## Alternatives considered

- **`renderFlutterWidget` (rasterize the Flutter UI to a PNG in the shared
  container).** One UI, pixel-identical to the app. Rejected as the primary path:
  a bitmap **can't be interactive** (no per-row complete/add buttons), doesn't get
  native Dynamic Type / dark-mode adaptation, and re-renders on every change.
  Kept only as a possible non-interactive rich tier.
- **Read the drift DB from the extension.** Impossible: separate sandbox; the
  containing app may not even be running. App Groups are the sanctioned bridge.
- **Ship widgets as a Flutter plugin package (as EventKit was).** Impossible: a
  plugin package cannot vend an App-Extension target. This is the deliberate
  deviation from the "no pbxproj surgery" pattern — recorded here so the committed
  `project.pbxproj`/entitlements diffs read as intentional, not accidental.
- **Honor a real 4×6 on iPhone.** Not offered by WidgetKit; cannot be built.
  Delivered as far as the platform allows (extraLarge on iPad/Mac, true 4×6 on
  Android, `systemLarge` ceiling on iPhone).

## Consequences

- New committed native surface in `ios/` (Widget Extension target, entitlements,
  SwiftUI + `AppIntent` shared with Runner), `macos/` (same, sandboxed), and
  `android/` (Glance provider + receiver + XML). `project.pbxproj` is now
  load-bearing — `flutter analyze`/`flutter test` do **not** compile Swift/Kotlin,
  so every native task is gated on a real `flutter build ios`/`apk`/`macos` and a
  device pass (the EventKit lesson, STATE "Blocked / notes").
- **macOS is gated on the inherited signing gap** (STATE: no macOS dev cert →
  `flutter build macos` fails today). OPH-135 ships the code but its device
  verification waits on the same cert as EventKit — not a blocker for iOS/Android.
- **Epic 12 depends on Epic 11 (i18n):** the snapshot writer needs the i18n facade
  to emit localized bucket/date labels. Ordering is i18n first, widgets second.
- `groupTasksForWidget` + the serializer are the only fully green-testable pieces;
  they carry the correctness weight (buckets, truncation, localization, "writes &
  updates on change"). The native layers are verified by build + device.
- Reuses the `alliswell://` scheme (ADR-0003) for widget deep links — the app's
  `onOpenURL`/router must accept `task/{id}` and a new `add` route.
- Establishes docs/WIDGETS.md as the binding widget plan (the NOTIFICATIONS.md /
  CALDAV.md analog) and DESIGN §8 as the widget visual spec.

## Revision — 2026-11-12 (#50; OPH-437, OPH-438, OPH-451)

Decision 5 said the WidgetKit timeline "re-buckets Today/Overdue when the app never opens". On iOS
that was not true: every timeline entry, the midnight ones included, rendered the one snapshot Dart
had written, bucketed for the day it was written. After midnight the widget showed yesterday's
Today under today's date until the app ran. Android was right all along — its midnight worker runs
Dart.

1. **The snapshot carries per-day views (version 6).** `days[]` holds today and the next two days,
   each a full view: date header, open count and its label, the next task, the buckets with that
   day's calendar rows, and every project view. Day 0 equals the top-level fields, which stay in
   place so an older extension still renders. A task completed today is not a dimmed row tomorrow.
2. **Each entry renders its own day.** The extension picks the `days[]` element equal to the
   entry's local date (one pure function, tested from the Runner test target). Past the last day
   it shows a **stale state**: the header date stays correct, the list is replaced by
   "Liste güncel değil · Güncellemek için aç", and the counter and the next task are hidden. The
   widget never shows an old list under a new date.
3. **What stays in Dart.** Grouping, the DESIGN §8 W1/W9 rules, labels and date formats are still
   computed only in Dart; native code chooses a day and draws it. The snapshot size limit is
   measured and locked by a test.
4. **One more write.** When the app goes to the background it writes the last snapshot and reloads
   the timelines (a foreground reload is outside WidgetKit's budget). The `home_widget`
   interactivity callback is registered only after the App Group is set.

Not in this revision: a widget that stays current while the app is swiped away (self-fetch with
its own widget token) has its own ADRs; iOS background refresh and silent push stay off
(ADR-0038 §8).
