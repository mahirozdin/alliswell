**Last updated:** 2026-07-14 (Epic 04 backend: OPH-030…034; local Docker infra restored)

**Repository:** https://github.com/mahirozdin/alliswell (public) — CI green since the first push
([run #1](https://github.com/mahirozdin/alliswell/actions)): migrations apply/rollback/re-apply
against real MySQL 8.4 and all unit+integration tests pass.

## Recently completed

- **Epic 04 — core domain API (OPH-030…034):** projects/tags/tasks CRUD under `/api/v1`,
  all workspace-authorized and soft-deleting. **Sync foundation:** `recordSyncWrite()`
  (src/db/sync.js) bumps `workspaces.revision` under row lock + appends `sync_revisions`
  in the same trx as every entity write — entity rows carry their revision. Tasks: filters
  (status/project/tag/due/urgent/parent) + ULID-cursor pagination, subtasks w/ cycle guard +
  subtree delete, checklist sub-resource, `PUT /tasks/:id/tags` diff semantics,
  complete/reopen (idempotent; archived immutable, `TASK_ARCHIVED`), reminder rows
  reconciled with task writes in-transaction (`src/db/reminders.js`). Tags: per-workspace
  slugs, tombstoned on delete so names can be recreated. Error codes in route files.
- **Local infra restored:** colima (brew) provides the Docker daemon — Docker Desktop not
  needed; `docker compose up -d mysql redis` + `npm run db:migrate` + `npm run
  test:integration` all work locally (`.env` maps host port **3307** because a brew MySQL
  9.7 occupies 3306; containers stay MySQL 8.4 internally).
- **Epic 03 — Auth (complete):**
  - **API:** register/login/refresh/logout + `GET /me` under `/api/v1`. argon2id (timing-safe
    dummy verify on unknown email); 15-min JWTs (iss `alliswell-api`, aud `alliswell-app`;
    `@fastify/jwt` v10 — numeric `expiresIn` is SECONDS); opaque 30-day refresh tokens stored
    as HMAC-SHA256(JWT_REFRESH_SECRET), rotation families with reuse detection (replay revokes
    the family, concurrent rotation settled by atomic claim UPDATE). `app.authenticate`
    (expired → `AUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRED`) + `app.requireWorkspaceMember(request, wsId, {roles})`.
    Auth routes rate-limited via `RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_MAX` (10/min default). Production refuses
    placeholder/short/identical JWT secrets. Error codes listed in apps/api/README.md.
  - **App:** feature-first `lib/src/features/auth/` — dio + AuthInterceptor (attach token,
    single-flight refresh-on-401, one retry), AuthRepository (session source of truth,
    change stream), Riverpod `authControllerProvider`, login/register screens, router guard
    (`/splash` → `/login`), Settings sign-out. Sessions persist via flutter_secure_storage
    (web: memory only, refresh-cookie flow planned) and restore on start. Unit tests stub
    knex (`apps/api/test/helpers/fakedb.js`) and dio (fake HttpClientAdapter).
- **Epic 01 — Foundation:** monorepo (npm workspaces), full docs set, Docker Compose
  (MySQL 8.4 + Redis 8 + optional api/adminer), Fastify API skeleton with health endpoints,
  Flutter 6-platform shell (Riverpod + go_router, adaptive navigation), GitHub Actions CI.
- **Epic 02 — Database:** knex migration baseline — 17 tables covering users/workspaces/members,
  refresh_tokens, projects/tags/tasks (+task_tags, checklist_items), notes (+note_tags,
  note_links), sync_revisions + client_mutations, calendar_accounts/calendar_event_links/reminders.
- **Epic 09 (partial):** CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, issue/PR templates.

## Blocked / notes

- ~~Local Docker daemon missing~~ — fixed 2026-07-14: colima + docker-compose installed via
  brew (`colima start` boots the VM after a reboot); broken Docker Desktop cli-plugin
  symlinks and the dead `credsStore` were cleaned from `~/.docker`. Local MySQL 9.7 (brew
  service) still owns port 3306 → repo `.env` uses `MYSQL_PORT=3307`/`DATABASE_PORT=3307`.
- ~~`JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` / `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` placeholders~~ — done in OPH-020: config falls
  back to labeled insecure dev secrets, production refuses placeholders/short/identical values.
- Apple EventKit work (OPH-077+) requires macOS/Xcode signing setup on the dev machine.
- Web builds keep tokens in memory only (signed out after a reload) — the httpOnly
  refresh-cookie flow is the planned hardening; see OPH-025 notes in TASKS.md.

## Environment assumptions

- Node ≥ 22 (dev machine: v25), Flutter 3.44 / Dart 3.12, Docker Desktop with compose v2.
- Local infra: `docker compose up -d mysql redis` then `npm run db:migrate`.

## How to continue (for agents)

1. Read [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) §2 (protocol) if you haven't.
2. Implement **OPH-035** per its checklist in [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) — snooze updates BOTH
   `tasks.snoozed_until` and the active reminder row (see `src/db/reminders.js`); preset
   math runs in the task's timezone.
3. Verify (`npm run lint && npm test`, integration tests if infra up), document, commit,
   then update this file's Snapshot + Recently completed.
